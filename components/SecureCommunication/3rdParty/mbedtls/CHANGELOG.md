# Changelog

All notable changes by HENSOLDT Cyber GmbH to this 3rd party module included in
the TRENTOS SDK will be documented in this file.

For more details it is recommended to compare the 3rd party module at hand with
the previous versions of the TRENTOS SDK or the baseline version.

## [1.3]

### Fixed

- Ensure that calculated index `hi` in `gcm_mult()` of `gcm.c` is always between
  0 and 15 to eliminate out-of-bounds errors.
- Adjust data type in the signature of function `read_curve_point()` in
  `trentos_ssl_cli.c`from `size_t*` to `uint32_t*` because function is only used
  for those data type.
- Add return in function `trentos_ssl_cli_exchange_key()` of `trentos_ssl_cli.c`
  if `ex_type` is not supported in order to avoid program flows that use
  variable `algEx` without being initialized.
- Fix printf format specifier in the `trentos_ssl_cli.c`.

### Changed

- Increase size of buffer `buf` of structure `mbedtls_aes_context` in `aes.h` to
  120 so that the expanded round key of the custom fixed slice implementation of
  AES256 fits in.
- Cosmetic update of comments and whitespace in some files.

### Added

- Update mbedTLS by merging version v2.16.11, tag mbedtls-2.16.11.

## [1.2]

### Fixed

- Fix a misplaced `#endif` in `library/ssl_tls.c` to remove unnecessary debug
output.

## [1.1]

### Changed

- Expose `dhm_check_range()` as part of a public interface.
- Align with changes in the TRENTOS Crypto API by renaming key attribute from
`exportable` to `keepLocal`.

### Added

- Update mbedTLS by merging version v2.16.8, tag mbedtls-2.16.8.

## [1.0]

### Changed

- Use the generic dataport default size `OS_DATAPORT_DEFAULT_SIZE`.
- Adapt the `OS_CryptoMac_init()` function call to receive a MAC key object to
conform to the changes in the TRENTOS Crypto API.
- Add the responsibility of allocating the digest object to the
`OS_CryptoDigest_clone()` function instead of always calling
`OS_CryptoDigest_init()` first.
- Adapt the overall error handling by:
  - replacing the `SEOS_` prefix in error code names with `OS_`,
  - renaming the error type from `seos_err_t` to `OS_Error_t`,
  - replacing the usage of `Debug_hexDump()` with the `Debug_DUMP()` macro,
  - adding the error translation code to the mbedTLS build.
- Set keyData structure to zero before exporting it in
`trentos_ssl_cli_export_cert_key()`.
- Expose `x509_name_cmp()` as a public function.
- Replace TRENTOS specific implementation in `crypto.h/.c` with separate files
based on functionality and replace mbedTLS log functions with TRENTOS log
functions in newly created files:
  - `trentos_ssl_cli.h/.c`,
  - `trentos_ssl_tls.h/.c`,
  - `trentos_x509_crt.h/.c`,
- Adjust function prototypes to pass only `hCrypto` handle instead of the SSL
context where possible.
- Adjust the build system to have 3 separate build targets for:
  - crypto,
  - certification,
  - TLS.
- Add `platform.c` to the build so it is possible to overwrite `calloc()` and
`free()` with customized implementations.

### Fixed

- Properly free the MAC/Key objects in case of an error.
- Change error messages to correctly output the failing function from
`OS_CryptoMac_init()` to `OS_CryptoMac_process()`/`OS_CryptoMac_finalize()`.

### Added

- Add TRENTOS specific configuration file `configs/config-trentos.h`.

## [0.9]

### Changed

- Apply code formatting changes.

### Added

- Adding an option to mbedTLS to use TRENTOS Crypto API for:
  - server signatures,
  - RSA certificate verification,
  - ECDH-based key exchanges,
  - DHM-based key exchange,
  - RF and session checksum,
  - AES-GCM encryption.
- Adding TRENTOS specific implementation by adding files `library/crypto.c`
and `include/mbedtls/crypto.h`.
- Start integration of mbedTLS based on commit ec904e which is based on version
2.16.0 from <https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls>.
